quadcopter
==========

this is the main file for a quadcopter v 1.0 (code, design, theory).
the project includes:
- C language code for a controller board (single action per command, 1 loop)
- fundamental physics concepts explaining the forces exerted, acceleration, potential/kinetic energy and more
- very rough drafts of the quadcopter frame and pieces' positions
- materials used and their measurements
